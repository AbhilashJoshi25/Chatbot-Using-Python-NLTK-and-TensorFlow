# Chatbot-Using-Python-NLTK-and-TensorFlow
In this project, I learnt to develop a custom chatbot using Python APIs of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library and TensorFlow. The chatbot will be a simple one whose functions can be built on and further enhanced.

Technologies: NLTK, Python, Pillow, TensorFlow
